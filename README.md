Hihi ✌️ I’m Joy, I'm a freshman at Georgia State University and I love 💖 coding.  Whether it’s game, AI, or software development, I’m in always my element. 

My big goal is to make a mark in the tech world and create something awesome and cool 🔥.

I love working with teams 😊, bouncing ideas around, and collaborating. 

But I’m just as comfortable working solo, diving deep into code. I’m pretty adaptable, quick to learn, and always up for a challenge.

I’m more of a rational thinker, making sure my solutions are practical and effective.  

I enjoy solving complex problems and bringing my ideas to life cause what's a better feeling than spending hours on a code and clicking the run button and it runs perfectly - NOTHING, it's so satisfying. 

Can’t wait to see where this journey takes me 😘!
